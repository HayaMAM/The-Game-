# Tic Tac Toe 

## Used Technologies

 I used JavaScript, JQuery, HTML and CSS to complete this game. 

## The Approach

The logic behind the game is simple and clear. I created a variable and if statement to switch between the players. I also created if statements for the winning possibilities of the game. Finally I created a function to alert the players of the winner of the game.
